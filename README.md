# 📚 Online Bookstore SQL Project

## 🧠 Overview

Welcome to the **Online Bookstore SQL Project** — a hands-on SQL data analysis project designed to simulate real-world querying of a retail database. This project explores a fictional bookstore’s relational database to uncover insights related to:

- Inventory (Books)
- Customers and geography
- Order history and sales performance

Through a series of progressively complex queries, the project builds proficiency in retrieving, filtering, joining, and aggregating data — all essential skills for data analysts and backend developers working with SQL.

## 🗂️ Dataset Structure

The database consists of **three interrelated tables**:

| Table Name   | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 📖 `books`    | Contains book details like title, genre, author, price, stock, and published year |
| 👥 `customers` | Stores customer information including name, country, and city |
| 🛒 `orders`    | Records of customer purchases including order date, quantity, and total amount |

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The project is divided into three levels of difficulty with specific goals:

### 📊 Basic Analysis
- Retrieve books by genre or year
- Find customers from specific countries
- View orders placed in a specific time frame

### 📈 Intermediate Insights
- Calculate books sold per genre
- Find average book prices by genre
- Identify repeat customers
- Discover bestselling books

### 📌 Advanced Metrics
- Analyze revenue and customer spend
- Rank authors by book sales
- Calculate stock remaining after sales

## 🧰 SQL Concepts Used

You'll apply the following SQL operations:

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
- `JOIN` (INNER and LEFT)
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- Aggregations: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`
- Subqueries and conditional logic (`IFNULL`, etc.)
